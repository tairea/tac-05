I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans. \n\nI can see we're working in the `/opt/adw` directory, which appears to be a git repository on the `feature-issue-7-adw-e211dda3-dark-mode-toggle` branch. I notice there's a specification file for a dark mode toggle feature.\n\nI'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I can:\n- ✅ Explore the codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep tools\n- ✅ Use read-only bash commands (ls, cat, grep, find, git log, etc.)\n- ✅ Analyze code patterns and architecture\n- ✅ Design implementation plans\n\nBut I **cannot**:\n- ❌ Create, modify, or delete any files\n- ❌ Run commands that change system state\n- ❌ Install packages or dependencies\n\nI'm here to help you understand the codebase and create thoughtful implementation plans.
