I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see this is an ADW (likely \"Automated Deployment Workflow\" or similar) project with Python code, webhooks, and deployment services. The working directory is `/opt/adw` and we're on the `main` branch.\n\nI notice there are some modified files:\n- `adws/adw_plan_build.py`\n- `adws/adw_plan_build_test.py`\n- `adws/adw_triggers/trigger_webhook.py`\n- `adws/deploy/adw-webhook.service`\n\nAnd several new Claude-related files in `.claude/` directories.\n\n**I'm ready to help you with any of the following:**\n\n1. **Explore the codebase** - I can read files, search for patterns, and understand the architecture\n2. **Design implementation plans** - Give me requirements and I'll create a detailed technical plan\n3. **Analyze existing code** - I can trace through code paths and explain how things work\n4. **Find patterns** - I can identify conventions and similar features to use as reference\n\n**Important reminder:** I'm in READ-ONLY mode for planning tasks. I can explore and design, but I cannot modify, create, or delete any files.\n\nWhat would you like to explore or plan today?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":1098,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWN3s1qCnpyeznnefyD8H","type":"assistant","uuid":"7173973e-01a5-4311-978d-5ebc682c30c9","timestamp":"2025-12-22T16:35:25.766Z"}
